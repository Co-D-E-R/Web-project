#Express

to stat the server app you have to use "app=express()"

After start to listensing for request "app.listen(3000 ()=>{})"
where 3000 are port that is  "localhost : 3000"

and to get a response we use "app.use(()=>{}) " any we get the request this call back will run

\\how to respond
    
res,req by passing argument in .use(req,res)
    where req:- gets the request and res:will genrate a new respond

//routing:-
taking incoming requests and a path that is requested and matching with some code.
there different HTTP verbs
get(),puts(),posts
express will differentiate between incoming request og different types

on routing we can also generate some patterns like /r/:subreddit/:subreddit
or /r/:subreddit/:postId
we can also accesses :subreddit value using params like   const {subreddit,postId}=req.params;

//query string
is the portion of URL that comes after ? mark and we can include information in key value pairs
In the request (req) that a particular property called query in that we can found a key value pairs made or based upon the query string.

 //nodemon is npm which automatically restart the server whenever there is any changes we made
